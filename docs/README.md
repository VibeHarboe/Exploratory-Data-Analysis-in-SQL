# 📘 docs/

This folder contains structured documentation to support the understanding, use, and presentation of all SQL techniques and concepts covered in the project. It serves as a **reference and learning companion** for anyone reviewing the repository — including peers, hiring managers, and fellow data professionals.

---

## 📂 Purpose

The documentation is designed to:

* Explain key SQL techniques with context and examples
* Supplement `.sql` files with theoretical background
* Serve as a practical knowledge base for real-world data work

It reflects the kind of internal documentation you'd find in professional analytics teams, data wikis, or onboarding guides.
